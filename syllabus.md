Office Hours:
* Mondays 1 - 2 PM
* Tuesdays 1 - 2 PM
* Fridays 1 - 2 PM

Zoom link for office hours:
[https://gvsu-edu.zoom.us/j/98637553783?pwd=RzJsazNrcDhFemFRTCtvN2xiblFnUT09](https://gvsu-edu.zoom.us/j/98637553783?pwd=RzJsazNrcDhFemFRTCtvN2xiblFnUT09)

The best way to contact me about the course is through
[Piazza](https://www.piazza.com/gvsu/winter2021/cis457/home).
I also regularly monitor the channel for this course on the unofficial
GVSU Discord,
though I will not post official announcements there and you are not responsible
for monitoring it.

I am always happy to schedule additional meetings outside of office hours,
and it is especially important with this class being online that you not
hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
Because it is used elsewhere in the class,
my default assumption will be to set up a Zoom meeting,
but we can also chat on Discord, Google Meet, or other platforms if that is
more convenient for you.

## Course Meetings

The course lectures will be delivered asynchronously.
Synchronous meeting times will occur twice weekly:
* 11 - 11:50 AM Mondays (Virutal Classroom)
* 3 - 4:50 PM Tuesdays (Virtual Lab)

Zoom link for meetings and labs:
[https://gvsu-edu.zoom.us/j/99095839766?pwd=eHZUbldONGg1UllaSTdqMHZMN3Vxdz09](https://gvsu-edu.zoom.us/j/99095839766?pwd=eHZUbldONGg1UllaSTdqMHZMN3Vxdz09)
(not that this is *different* from the meeting link for office hours)

The lab sections on Tuesdays will begin with a brief introduction of the
week's lab followed by time to work with your partner and ask questions about
the lab.
The classroom section will be time for guided activities and questions about
lecture content.
